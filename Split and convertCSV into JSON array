Split and convert CSV into JSON array
Dear Team,

 

i am creating a basic flow to achieve one requirement.

 

Scenario:

Step1:

I have CSV data as source :

eg: Naeem,Umer,AAA;BBB;CCC;DDD

 

Step2:

Convert CSV data to JSON using MAP

in Map i am using scripting function to split the above bold field AAA;BBB;CCC;DDD.

 

Step3:

its returning output as json:

[

{

"name": "DI",

"lastName": "YA",

"addresses": [

"DDD"

]

}

]

Above output is it iterating but return the last splited value.

 

 

But i want to below output

[

{

"name": "DI",

"lastName": "YA",

"addresses": [

"AAA",

"BBB",

"CCC",

"DDD"

]

}

]

 

Please see the attached snap as well for clear picture.
